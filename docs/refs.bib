	Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is the presentation of a general formula for the asymptotic variance of a semiparametric estimator. A particularly important feature of this formula is a way of accounting for the presence of nonparametric estimates of nuisance functions. The general form of an adjustment factor for nonparametric estimates is derived and analyzed. The usefulness of the formula is illustrated by deriving propositions on invariance of the limiting distribution with respect to the nonparametric estimator, conditions for nonparametric estimation to have no effect on the asymptotic distribution, and the form of a correction term for the presence of nonparametric projection and density estimators. Examples discussed are quasi-maximum likelihood estimation of index models, panel probit with semiparametric individual effects, average derivatives, and inverse density weighted least squares. The paper also develops a set of regularity conditions for the validity of the asymptotic variance formula. Primitive regularity conditions are derived for <tex-math>$\sqrt{n}\text{-consistency}$</tex-math> and asymptotic normality for functions of series estimators of projections. Specific examples are polynomial estimators of average derivative and semiparametric panel probit models.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, the role of the propensity score in the efficient estimation of average treatment effects is examined. Under the assumption that the treatment is ignorable given some observed characteristics, it is shown that the propensity score is ancillary for estimation of the average treatment effects. The propensity score is not ancillary for estimation of average treatment effects on the treated. It is suggested that the marginal value of the propensity score lies entirely in the "dimension reduction." Efficient semiparametric estimators of average treatment effects and average treatment effects on the treated are shown to take the form of relevant sample averages of the data completed by the nonparametric imputation method. It is shown that the projection on the propensity score is not necessary for efficient semiparametric estimation of average treatment effects on the treated even if the propensity score is known. An application to the experimental data reveals that conditioning on the propensity score may even result in a loss of efficiency.},

	Abstract = {We are interested in estimating the average effect of a binary treatment on a scalar outcome. If assignment to the treatment is exogenous or unconfounded, that is, independent of the potential outcomes given covariates, biases associated with simple treatment‐control average comparisons can be removed by adjusting for differences in the covariates. Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) show that adjusting solely for differences between treated and control units in the propensity score removes all biases associated with differences in covariates. Although adjusting for differences in the propensity score removes all the bias, this can come at the expense of efficiency, as shown by Hahn (1998), Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd (1998), and Robins, Mark, and Newey (1992). We show that weighting by the inverse of a nonparametric estimate of the propensity score, rather than the true propensity score, leads to an efficient estimate of the average treatment effect. We provide intuition for this result by showing that this estimator can be interpreted as an empirical likelihood estimator that efficiently incorporates the information about the propensity score.},

	Abstract = { Abstract The goal of this paper is to develop techniques to simplify semiparametric inference. We do this by deriving a number of numerical equivalence results. These illustrate that in many cases, one can obtain estimates of semiparametric variances using standard formulas derived in the well-known parametric literature. This means that for computational purposes, an empirical researcher can ignore the semiparametric nature of the problem and do all calculations as if it were a parametric situation. We hope that this simplicity will promote the use of semiparametric procedures. },
