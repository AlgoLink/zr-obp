class DoublyRobust(InverseProbabilityWeighting):
    """Estimate the policy value by Doubly Robust (DR).

    Similar to DM, DR first learns a supervised machine learning model, such as random
    forest, ridge regression, and gradient boosting, to predict the mean reward function (:math:`\\mu(x, a) = E[Y | X=x, A=a]`).
    It then uses it to estimate the policy value as follows.

    .. math::

            \\hat{V}_{DR} (\\pi; \\mathcal{D}) =
            \\hat{V}_{DM} (\\pi; \\mathcal{D}) + \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^T \\frac{\\pi (a_t | x_t)}{\\pi_b (a_t | x_t)} (Y_t - \\hat{\\mu} (x_t, a_t))

    where :math:`\\mathcal{D}=\\{ (X_t,A_t,Y_t) \\}_{t=1}^{T}` is logged bandit feedback data collected by :math:`\\pi_b`.
    :math:`\\hat{\\mu}` is the regression function and :math:`\\hat{\\mu} (x, a)` is an estimated reward given :math:`x` and :math:`a`.
    To estimate the mean reward function, please use `obp.ope.regression_model.RegressionModel`,
    which supports several fitting methods specific to OPE such as *more robust doubly robust*.

    DR mimics IPW to use a weighted version of rewards, but DR also uses the estimated mean reward
    function (the regression model) as a control variate to decrease the variance.
    It preserves the consistency of IPW if either the importance weight or
    the mean reward estimator is accurate (a property called double robustness).
    Moreover, DR is semiparametric efficient when the mean reward estimator is correctly specified.
