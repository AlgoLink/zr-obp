## Overview

### **Open Bandit Dataset (OBD)**

*Open Bandit Dataset* is public real-world logged bandit feedback data.
The dataset is provided by [ZOZO, Inc.](https://corp.zozo.com/en/about/profile/), the largest Japanese fashion e-commerce company with over 5 billion USD market capitalization (as of May 2020).
The company uses multi-armed bandit algorithms to recommend fashion items to users in a large-scale fashion e-commerce platform called [ZOZOTOWN](https://zozo.jp/).
The following figure presents examples of displayed fashion items as actions.

</p>

We collected the data in a 7-days experiment in late November 2019 on three “campaigns,” corresponding to all, men', and women' items, respectively.
Each campaign randomly uses either the Random algorithm or the Bernoulli Thompson Sampling (Bernoulli TS) algorithm for each user impression.

### **Open Bandit Pipeline (OBP)**


*Open Bandit Pipeline* is a series of implementations of dataset preprocessing, offline bandit simulation, and evaluation of OPE estimators.
This pipeline allows researchers to focus on building their OPE estimator and easily compare it with others’ methods in realistic and reproducible ways.
Thus, it facilitates reproducible research on bandit algorithms and off-policy evaluation.

### Topics and Tasks
Currently, Open Bandit Dataset & Pipeline facilitate evaluation and comparison related to the following research topics.

- **Bandit Algorithms**: Our data include large-scale logged bandit feedback collected by the uniform random policy. Therefore, it enables the evaluation of new online bandit algorithms, including contextual and combinatorial algorithms, in a large real-world setting.


- **Off-Policy Evaluation**: We present implementations of behavior policies used when collecting datasets as a part of our pipeline. Our open data also contains logged bandit feedback data generated by multiple behavior policies. Therefore, it enables the evaluation of off-policy evaluation with ground-truth for the performance of counterfactual policies.


## Installation

You can install OBP using Python's package manager `pip`.

```
pip install obp
```

You can install OBP from source.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/st-tech/zr-obp
cd obp
python setup.py install
```


### Requirements
- **python>=3.7.0**
- numpy>=1.18.1
- pandas>=0.25.1
- scipy>=1.4.1
- scikit-learn>=0.23.1
- tqdm>=4.41.1
- pyyaml>=5.1


## Usage

We show an example of conducting an offline evaluation of the performance of Bernoulli Thompson Sampling (BernoulliTS) as a counterfactual policy using *Replay Method* and logged bandit feedback generatedf by the Random policy (behavior policy).
We see that only ten lines of code are sufficient to complete OPE from scratch.

```python
# a case for implementing OPE of the BernoulliTS policy using log data generated by the Random policy
from obp.dataset import OpenBanditDataset
from obp.policy import BernoulliTS
from obp.simulator import run_bandit_simulation
from obp.ope import OffPolicyEvaluation ReplayMethod

# (1) Data loading and preprocessing
dataset = OpenBanditDataset(behavior_policy='random', campaign='all')
train, test = dataset.split_data(test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# (2) Offline Bandit Simulation
counterfactual_policy = BernoulliTS(n_actions=dataset.n_actions, len_list=dataset.len_list)
selected_actions = run_bandit_simulation(train=train, policy=counterfactual_policy)

# (3) Off-Policy Evaluation
ope = OffPolicyEvaluation(train=train, ope_estimators=[ReplayMethod()])
estimated_policy_value = ope.estimate_policy_values(selected_actions=selected_actions)

# estimated performance of BernoulliTS relative to the ground-truth performance of Random
relative_policy_value_of_bernoulli_ts = estimated_policy_value['rm'] / test['reward'].mean()
print(relative_policy_value_of_bernoulli_ts) # 1.21428...
```

A formal introduction with the same example can be found at [quickstart](./examples/quickstart/quickstart-evaluation-of-bandit-algorithms.ipynb).
Below, we explain some important features in the example flow.


### (1) Data loading and preprocessing

We prepare easy-to-use data loader for Open Bandit Dataset.
We handle dataset preprocessing as well as standardized train/test splitting.

```python
# load and preprocess raw data in "All" campaign collected by the Random policy
dataset = OpenBanditDataset(behavior_policy='random', campaign='all')
# split the data into 70% training and 30% test sets
train, test = dataset.split_data(test_size=0.3, random_state=0)

print(train.keys())
# dict_keys(['n_rounds', 'n_actions', 'action', 'position', 'reward', 'pscore', 'context', 'action_context'])
```

Users can implement their own feature engineering in the `pre_process` method of `OpenBanditDataset` class.
We show an example of implementing some new feature engineering processes in [`./examples/obd/dataset.py`](./examples/obd/dataset.py). Moreover, by following the interface of `BaseBanditDataset` class in `./obp/dataset.py`, one can handle future open datasets for bandit algorithms other than our OBD.

### (2) Bandit Simulation

After preparing a dataset, we now run **offline bandit simulation** on the logged bandit feedback as follows.

```python
# define a counterfacutal policy, which is the Bernoulli TS policy here
counterfactual_policy = BernoulliTS(n_actions=dataset.n_actions, len_list=dataset.len_list)
# run an offline bandit simulation on the training set
selected_actions = run_bandit_simulation(train=train, policy=counterfactual_policy)
```

`run_bandit_simulation` function takes `BanditPolicy` class and `train` (a dictionary storing the training set of the bandit feedback) as inputs and runs offline bandit simulation of a given bandit policy. `selected_actions` is an array of selected actions during the offline bandit simulation by the counterfactual policy. Users can implement their own bandit algorithms by following the interface of `BanditPolicy` in [`./obp/policy/base.py`](./obp/policy/base.py).

### (3) Off-Policy Evaluation

Our final step is **off-policy evaluation** (OPE), which attempts to estimate the performance of bandit algorithms using log data generated by offline bandit simulation.
Our pipeline also provides an easy procedure for doing OPE as follows.

```python
# estimate the policy value of BernoulliTS based on actions selected by that policy
ope = OffPolicyEvaluation(train=train, ope_estimators=[ReplayMethod()])
estimated_policy_value = ope.estimate_policy_values(selected_actions=selected_actions)
print(estimated_policy_value) # {'rm': 0.003717..}

# comapre the estimated performance of BernoulliTS (counterfactual policy)
# with the ground-truth performance of Random (behavior policy)
relative_policy_value_of_bernoulli_ts = estimated_policy_value['rm'] / test['reward'].mean()
# our OPE procedure suggests that BernoulliTS improves Random by 21.4%
print(relative_policy_value_of_bernoulli_ts) # 1.21428...
```
Users can implement their own OPE estimator by following the interface of `BaseOffPolicyEstimator` class in [./obp/ope/estimators.py](./obp/ope/estimators.py). `OffPolicyEvaluation` class summarizes and compares the estimated policy values by several off-policy estimators. A detailed usage of this class can be found at [quickstart](./examples/quickstart/quickstart-evaluation-of-bandit-algorithms.ipynb). `test['reward'].mean()` is the empirical mean of factual rewards in the log and thus is the ground-truth performance of the behavior policy (the Random policy in this example.).
